/*
Third program
Scenario: you want a program that takes two numbers from the user and reports their sum. 
Requirements
Name a form 'calc'.
Create a function named 'Calculate' that takes two parameters, adds them together, and returns the answer to the main program. Name the parameters 'num1' and 'num2'. 
Do not use any global variables in the function. 
Create a variable in the main program named 'summedNumbers'.
In the main program, get two numbers from the user, make sure they are numbers, then call the function, sending it the two numbers. 
Hint: Remember, the two numbers must be passed into the function when you call it from the main program. Name the variables in the main program different names than the function Calculate parameter names num1 and num2 to avoid confusion.
All output must be done in the main program, not in the function.
Output to the console using this format:

The sum of X and Y is Z.     (X  and Y are from the user; Z is the sum returned by the function).
