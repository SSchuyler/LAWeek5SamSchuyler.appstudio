/*
Second program
Scenario: you want a program that outputs names to the console, one name per line.
Requirements
Name a form 'for'.
Use a for loop.
Note: see if you can do this using a for loop with only one line of code in it. 
Create an array named 'names' that holds this data:

Bob, Janet, Tom, Erin, Lucy, Alyssa, Dustin
Each time the loop runs, it must output a name to the console. So eventually your program will have output each name, one name per line.
Bob
Janet
Tom
etc.
