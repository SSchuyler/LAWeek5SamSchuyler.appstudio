/*
First Program
Scenario: you want a program that runs as many times as the user wants it to run. At each iteration, it will output a message.
Requirements
Name a form 'while'.
Use a 'while' loop. 
Each time the loop runs, it must output a line of text to the console that shows the value of 'i' in the format shown below at that iteration of the loop.
     This is loop iteration 1.
     This is loop iteration 2.
     etc.     
*/
/*
let user = prompt('insert a number for how many iterations you would like to repeat')
let num = 1

while(num < user){
  console.log(`This is loop iteration ${num}`)
  num = num + 1
}

console.log(`This is the final iteration, ${num}.`)
